1:- Heat oil in a pan and add cinnamon stick, cardamom, and cumin seeds. Let roast and, after a few seconds, add finely chopped onions and salt and saute until golden.

2:- Once the onions are golden and tender, add the masalas (spices) as follows: ginger-garlic paste, turmeric powder, cumin powder, garam masala, coriander powder, red chilli

3:- powder, green chillies, and curry leaves. Mix all the ingredients well and then add...

4:- chopped tomato, and a little bit of water (1/2 cup) and cook until everything turns soft (5-6 minutes). You can also add 1/4 cup (65g) tomato paste in place of the 1 tomato to get a very smooth gravy.

5:- Once the oil starts to separate, add the cleaned and sliced mushrooms and mix them well with the masala mixture. Cook for 3-4 minutes. Then, add 1/4 cup (or slightly more) required water and cook until the mushrooms are fully done. You should have a gravy-esque consistency: something that can be mixed with rice or accompanied by naan or roti or an equivalent flatbread.

6:- Finally, garnish with chopped coriander leaves and turn off the heat. If desired, add 1 tsp of ghee on the top to enhance the flavor.

7:- Serve with rice or naan.
